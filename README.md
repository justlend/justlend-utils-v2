This is a utility library designed for interacting with the JustLend V2 protocol smart contracts on the TRON network. It encapsulates complex contract interaction logic (such as deposits, borrowing, and collateral management) and provides support for both native TRX and TRC20 tokens.

The project includes core blockchain tool wrappers, helper functions, and a React-based example application.

## Features

* **Vault Interactions**: Supports standard ERC4626-style vault operations, including depositing (`depositToVault`) and redeeming (`redeemFromVault`).
* **Lending Market**: Encapsulates core lending logic, including:
    * Supplying Collateral (`supplyCollateral`)
    * Withdrawing Collateral (`withdrawCollateral`)
    * Borrowing (`borrow`)
    * Repaying (`repay`).
* **Native TRX Support**: Provides specialized proxy methods for handling native TRX interactions, including `depositTrxToVault`, `borrowTrx`, `depositTrxToWtrx` for TRX → WTRX wrapping, and `withdrawTrxFromWtrx` for WTRX → TRX unwrapping.
* **Liquidation**: Public-liquidator entry points — preview the loan-token amount required (`getLoanTokenAmountNeed`) and execute the seizure (`liquidate`).
* **Reward Claim Helpers**: Query Merkle root readiness (`getMerkleRoot`), check per-user claim status (`isClaimed`), and batch-claim across rounds (`multiClaim`). Legacy/NEW USDD rewards use single-token amounts; general multi-token and SBM V2 rewards require their respective distributors and array amounts.
* **Energy Estimation**: Includes tools for estimating transaction energy consumption (`estimateSupplyTrxGas`).
* **Data Formatting**: Built-in `BigNumber` handling and amount formatting utilities.
* **Wallet Adapter**: Integrated with `@tronweb3` wallet adapters, supporting TronLink.

## Installation

This library is not published to npm. Install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Install via GitHub
npm install github:justlend/justlend-utils-v2
# or
pnpm add github:justlend/justlend-utils-v2
```

`tronweb` and `bignumber.js` are pulled in automatically as dependencies — no separate install needed.

## Usage

### 1. Initialization

This library requires a valid `TronWeb` instance to sign and broadcast transactions. **You must inject the TronWeb instance before calling any contract methods.**

**Option A: Browser (TronLink / Wallet Adapters)**

```javascript
import { tronObj } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

// Call this after the wallet is connected and ready
if (window.tronWeb && window.tronWeb.ready) {
  tronObj.tronWeb = window.tronWeb;
  
  // Set the sender address used for write transactions. Either global works;
  // `tronObj.defaultAccount` takes precedence over `window.defaultAccount`.
  tronObj.defaultAccount = window.tronWeb.defaultAddress.base58;
}

```

**Option B: Node.js (Server-side)**

```javascript
import { TronWeb } from 'tronweb';
import { tronObj } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

const tronWeb = new TronWeb({
  fullHost: 'https://nile.trongrid.io', // use https://api.trongrid.io for Mainnet
  privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY
});

// Inject the instance with private key
tronObj.tronWeb = tronWeb;

// Required in Node (there is no `window`): set the sender address explicitly.
tronObj.defaultAccount = tronWeb.defaultAddress.base58;

// Optional: pin the network instead of inferring it from the node host.
// tronObj.network = 'nile'; // built-in contract addresses: 'main' | 'nile'

```

### 2. Energy direct purchase (explicit API configuration)

Energy direct purchase uses a separately deployed API. The library deliberately does not provide a
production URL or economic fallbacks: inject the URL, then load limits, durations, prices, and pool
capacity from the live API.

```javascript
import { createEnergyPurchaseClient } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

const energy = createEnergyPurchaseClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.JUSTLEND_ENERGY_API_URL,
  tronWeb,
  // Required in Node.js: use a durable store shared by every process.
  storage: durableRiskStorage,
  // Required in Node.js: an atomic, non-waiting file/DB lock provider.
  paymentLock: durablePaymentLock
});

const config = await energy.getConfig();
const quote = await energy.quote({
  receivers: ['TReceiverAddress...'],
  energyPerReceiver: config.energy_presets[0],
  duration: config.supported_durations[0],
  config
});

// Read-only calls are safe to use before the production write endpoint is enabled.
console.log(quote.total_sun, quote.payment_address, await energy.getPoolHealth());
```

The `purchase()` workflow performs a fresh authoritative quote, builds a native TRX payment,
requests a wallet signature, submits the signed transaction to the backend, and polls the order.
It **never broadcasts the payment from the client**. Ambiguous submissions retry only the same
signed transaction and leave a payment-risk marker that blocks silent creation of another payment.
Risk storage contains metadata only (`signedTxId`, status, timestamps, and network fingerprint),
never the signed body or an order access token. In the same client session, call
`reconcilePaymentRisks(payerAddress)` for read-only chain reconciliation. Replaying the in-memory
signed request requires an explicit `reconcilePaymentRisks(payerAddress, { confirmReplay: true })`
call, and every risk API verifies that `payerAddress` matches the current `tronWeb.defaultAddress`
(or the client-level `payerAddress` / `getCurrentPayerAddress` binding). After a restart the signed
body is intentionally unavailable; the metadata marker remains blocked until chain evidence or an
operator recovery process resolves it. Network changes and legacy/incomplete markers also stay
blocked. Reconciled records expose
`chainStatus` (`observed`/`included` from FullNode, then `solidified` from SolidityNode) and
`chainExecution`; unavailable or missing RPC evidence never permits a new signature.

In a browser, the client uses same-origin `localStorage` plus the Web Locks API across tabs. If Web
Locks is unavailable, pass a cross-context `paymentLock`. In Node.js there is no safe implicit
fallback: provide durable `storage` (`getItem`/`setItem`/`removeItem`) and a `paymentLock` exposing
`tryRunExclusive(key, task)`. The lock must be shared by all processes and **fail immediately** when
already held; it must not queue a duplicate purchase. Storage methods are synchronous: `setItem`
must not return until the record is durably committed. A single adapter may implement both APIs.

```javascript
const result = await energy.purchase({
  payerAddress: tronWeb.defaultAddress.base58,
  receivers: ['TReceiverAddress...'],
  energyPerReceiver: config.energy_presets[0],
  duration: config.supported_durations[0],
  expectedAmountSun: quote.total_sun,
  expectedPayAddress: quote.payment_address,
  signTransaction: unsigned => tronWeb.trx.sign(unsigned)
});
```

Do not log or persist `signed_transaction`: anyone who obtains it may broadcast it before expiry.
The default browser storage is used only for non-replayable risk metadata; legacy records containing
`signedRequest` are scrubbed when the client initializes with a current payer (or on the first risk
read when the payer is supplied dynamically) after upgrading.

### 3. Contract Interactions

Mainnet lending helpers default to the current V2 `MoolahProxy`
(`TDH4dhmVQQNc1ZNudJwWzBcs2h6ahhWrpp`) and `TrxProviderProxy`
(`TMDENHFSiRzmJNSEBAFmrDbLkQ672iPN8H`). Nile lending defaults are unchanged.
Updating these defaults does **not** migrate positions or token allowances from
legacy deployments. Integrations managing legacy positions must keep passing the
corresponding legacy proxy explicitly; integrations using the current deployment
must check allowances against the actual spender. No approval or migration is
performed automatically.

**Deposit to Vault**

```javascript
import { depositToVault, approve, getAllowance, toChainAmount } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

const handleDeposit = async () => {
  const vaultAddress = "THwTBAmVoZTp4NY6HxJUHGDFGerDn9vuEW"; 
  const assetAddress = "TPYwAC9Y4uUcT2QH3WPPjqxzJSJWymMoMS";
  const userAddress = "TUserAddress...";
  const amount = "100"; // Amount in human-readable format (e.g., 100 USDT)
  const decimals = 6;

  // 1. Check Allowance
  const allowance = await getAllowance(assetAddress, userAddress, vaultAddress);
  const chainAmount = toChainAmount(amount, decimals);

  // 2. Approve if needed
  if (allowance.lt(chainAmount)) {
    console.log("Approving...");
    await approve(assetAddress, vaultAddress, { amount: chainAmount });
  }

  // 3. Deposit
  const res = await depositToVault(vaultAddress, amount, decimals, userAddress);
  console.log("TxID:", res.transaction.txID);
};

```

**Asset amounts versus raw shares**

`repay`, `redeemFromVault`, `redeemTrxFromVault`, `getLoanTokenAmountNeed`, and
`liquidate` accept either a human-readable asset amount or a raw share count.
Omitted/null shares and numeric, string, bigint, or BigNumber zero all select
asset mode. Positive shares select share mode: pass zero or null for the asset
amount instead of specifying both. Invalid, negative, fractional, unsafe-number,
or overflowing uint256 share counts are rejected before any chain call. Use an
integer string for large share counts; shares are never decimal-scaled by the SDK.

For `redeemTrxFromVault(vault, assets, legacyDecimals, shares, receiver, owner, ...)`,
the third argument is deprecated and ignored, but its position is retained for
compatibility. Asset withdrawals always convert human TRX to SUN at **6 decimals**,
even if the vault's share token uses 18 decimals. Pass `undefined` in that slot in
new code. In share mode, pass the raw share integer without rescaling it.

`repayWithTrx` uses the same numeric zero/share validation. Its `amount` has an
additional role in share mode: it remains the human-TRX funding budget for
`callValue`, not a second repayment selector. An explicit `sharesCallValueAmount`
is already in SUN and takes precedence as the funding budget; the share count
must not be used as the TRX payment amount.

**Supply Collateral**

```javascript
import { supplyCollateral } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

// Define market parameters (Required for V2 interactions)
const marketParams = {
  borrowAddress: "TLoanTokenAddress...",
  collateralAddress: "TCollateralAddress...",
  oracle: "TOracleAddress...",
  irm: "TIRMAddress...",
  lltv: "0.8" // Liquidation LTV as a human-readable ratio (e.g. 0.8 = 80%).
              // Pass the plain ratio — the library scales it by 1e18 internally.
              // Must exactly match the market's on-chain lltv, or the market id won't resolve.
};

const tx = await supplyCollateral(
  marketParams,
  "50", // amount
  18,   // decimals
  "TUserAddress...",          // onBehalf
  "TMoolahContractAddress..." // optional JustLend Moolah proxy override
);

```

**Liquidate an Unhealthy Position**

```javascript
import { getLoanTokenAmountNeed, liquidate, approve, getAllowance, getContractsAddress } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

const marketId = '0x...'; // bytes32 — fetched from Moolah `getId(marketParams)`
const borrower = 'TBorrowerAddress...';
const loanTokenAddr = 'TLoanTokenAddress...';
const userAddr = 'TYourAddress...';
const seizedAssets = '50';   // collateral to seize (human-readable)
const decimals = 18;
// Resolve once for the active network. Use this same target for the whole flow.
const liquidatorAddr = getContractsAddress('PublicLiquidatorProxy');

// 1. Preview how many loan tokens you need to repay
const need = await getLoanTokenAmountNeed(marketId, seizedAssets, null, decimals, liquidatorAddr);
console.log('Loan tokens required:', need.toString());

// 2. Approve the PublicLiquidator on the loan token if needed
const allowance = await getAllowance(loanTokenAddr, userAddr, liquidatorAddr);
if (allowance.lt(need)) {
  await approve(loanTokenAddr, liquidatorAddr, { amount: need.toFixed(0) });
}

// 3. Execute the liquidation
const tx = await liquidate(marketId, borrower, seizedAssets, null, decimals, liquidatorAddr);
console.log('TxID:', tx.transaction.txID);

// Alternatively, liquidate by repaidShares — pass shares as the 4th arg, set seizedAssets to 0:
// await liquidate(marketId, borrower, 0, '500000000', 6, liquidatorAddr);
```

**Wrap TRX ↔ WTRX**

```javascript
import { depositTrxToWtrx, withdrawTrxFromWtrx } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

// Wrap 100 TRX into WTRX. Defaults to the network's WtrxContractProxy from config.
await depositTrxToWtrx(100);

// Unwrap 100 WTRX back into native TRX through WtrxContractProxy.withdraw().
await withdrawTrxFromWtrx(100);
```

**Claim V2 Mining Rewards**

Reward deployments have different ABIs and independent Merkle roots:

| Registry key | Purpose | `claim.amount` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MerkleDistributor` | Legacy/general single-token rewards; existing helper default | Scalar raw amount |
| `MerkleDistributorNEWUSDD` | Single-token USDD rewards; **not** a multi-token distributor | Scalar raw amount |
| `MultiMerkleDistributor` | General multi-token rewards | Array of raw amounts |
| `MerkleDistributorV2` | SBM V2 mining rewards | Array of raw amounts |

For V2 mining, explicitly select `MerkleDistributorV2` for **both reads and the
claim**. Supply periods/proofs from the backend for that exact distributor and
account. Each period has `{ merkleIndex, index, amount, merkleProof }`, where
`amount` is an array of integer strings in token base units. Preserve the backend's
token order and **all zero slots**, even when only one token has a non-zero reward.
These entries describe contract capabilities, not whether a mining campaign is
active. Claim only when the relevant campaign has published claimable rewards.
Multi-token ABI support does not imply that every token currently earns rewards.

```javascript
import { getContractsAddress, getMerkleRoot, isClaimed, multiClaim } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

// `periods` must contain V2 proofs and array-valued amounts for the sender.
async function claimV2Rewards(periods) {
  // Resolves for the active network; throws if no V2 distributor is configured.
  const distributor = getContractsAddress('MerkleDistributorV2');
  const claimable = [];
  for (const p of periods) {
    // All-zero bytes32 means the root is not published yet; read failures throw.
    const root = await getMerkleRoot(p.merkleIndex, distributor);
    if (root === `0x${'0'.repeat(64)}`) continue;
    if (await isClaimed(p.merkleIndex, p.index, distributor)) continue;
    claimable.push(p);
  }

  if (claimable.length === 0) return null;
  return await multiClaim(claimable, distributor);
}
```

The default `multiClaim(claims)` remains single-token for compatibility. To claim
USDD single-token rewards, pass `getContractsAddress('MerkleDistributorNEWUSDD')`
and that distributor's scalar-valued claims. Never reuse a proof for a different
distributor or convert scalar amounts into arrays to switch deployments.

`multiClaim` rejects empty batches, missing amounts, mixed scalar/array batches,
empty amount arrays, and amount shapes incompatible with a known registry entry
before transaction construction. Explicit custom distributor addresses still use
the supplied amount shape to select the ABI; callers must verify their deployment
and proofs. The SDK never silently reroutes claims. Neither multi-token deployment
is configured on Nile; there is no mainnet fallback.

Nile also has no verified **default single-token** reward distributor configured.
Calling `getMerkleRoot`, `isClaimed`, or `multiClaim` without an explicit distributor
on Nile fails with a clear "not configured" error before a chain call. Supply a
verified Nile distributor and matching proofs/ABI explicitly; the former default
was not a deployed contract on Nile and is no longer used.

### 4. Helpers

```javascript
import { formatNumber, toChainAmount } from 'justlend-v2-utils';

console.log(formatNumber("123456.789", 2)); // Output: "123,456.78"
const raw = toChainAmount("1", 6); // Output: "1000000"

```

## API Overview

All main methods are exported from `systemV2.js`:

| Method Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `depositToVault` | Deposit assets into a Vault |
| `redeemFromVault` | Redeem assets from a Vault |
| `supplyCollateral` | Supply assets as collateral |
| `withdrawCollateral` | Withdraw collateral |
| `borrow` | Borrow assets |
| `repay` | Repay a loan |
| `depositTrxToVault` | Deposit native TRX |
| `borrowTrx` | Borrow native TRX |
| `depositTrxToWtrx` | Wrap native TRX into WTRX via `WtrxContractProxy.deposit()` |
| `withdrawTrxFromWtrx` | Unwrap WTRX into native TRX via `WtrxContractProxy.withdraw()` |
| `getLoanTokenAmountNeed` | View — preview how many loan tokens are required to seize a given amount of collateral (or to cover a given amount of borrow shares) |
| `liquidate` | Liquidate an unhealthy position via `PublicLiquidatorProxy` (by `seizedAssets` or by `repaidShares`) |
| `getMerkleRoot` | View — read the on-chain Merkle root for a mining round; returns a bytes32 value (including the all-zero sentinel) and throws when the read fails |
| `isClaimed` | View — check whether a `(merkleIndex, index)` pair has already been claimed |
| `multiClaim` | Batch-claim rewards; retains the single-token default and checks amount shape against known distributor ABIs |

*Note: Methods involving lending usually require a `marketParams` object containing contract addresses for the Oracle, IRM, etc. Reward reads and claims default to the legacy single-token `MerkleDistributor`; V2 mining requires explicitly passing `MerkleDistributorV2`. See the reward deployment table above.*

## Project Structure

* **`utils/blockchain.js`**: Core TronWeb instance wrapper, handling transaction triggering, signing, and broadcasting.
* **`utils/systemV2.js`**: Business logic layer containing all core contract method wrappers for JustLend V2.
* **`utils/helper.js`**: Utilities for number conversion, formatting, and BigNumber configuration.
* **`config.js`**: Keyless read-only network configuration (defaults to TRON Mainnet) and trusted RPC-host validation.
* **`Example.jsx`**: React component example demonstrating how to connect a wallet and call contracts.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `src/config.js`. Its **keyless, read-only fallback client** connects to **TRON Mainnet** through `https://api.trongrid.io`. This default cannot sign transactions. Write operations require an explicitly injected browser or Node.js TronWeb instance plus a sender address.

Set `JUSTLEND_FULLHOST=https://nile.trongrid.io` or `https://api.nileex.io` to use Nile for the fallback client in Node.js. Both [official Nile HTTP endpoints](https://developers.tron.network/docs/networks#nile-testnet) are accepted and resolve to the same network. Known RPC hosts are matched exactly, not by substring. For an operator-controlled custom HTTPS node, set `JUSTLEND_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_FULLHOST=true` and set `tronObj.network` explicitly; loopback development URLs are also allowed but still require an explicit network.

```javascript
const Config = {
  chain: {
    // No private key is configured for the fallback client.
    fullHost: 'https://api.trongrid.io'
  },
  feeLimit: 200000000,
  trxPrecision: 1e6,
  contracts: {
